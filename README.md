# Comparative-Analysis-of-Ada-Hessian-and-1st-Order-Optimizers-for-CSI-Based-Sign-Language-Recognition



This repository contains the implementation and experimental analysis of **Ada-Hessian**, a second-order optimization method, compared against several **first-order optimizers** for **CSI-based sign language recognition**.

The project was completed for \*\*AMAT 591: Optimization Methods and Nonlinear Programming (Spring 2025)\*\* at the \*\*University at Albany\*\*.





###### **📌 Project Overview**



First-order optimizers such as SGD and Adam dominate deep learning due to their efficiency but are often highly sensitive to hyperparameter choices. This project investigates whether incorporating \*\*second-order curvature information\*\* via \*\*Ada-Hessian\*\* can improve convergence speed, stability, and robustness when training neural networks on \*\*WiFi CSI-based sign language data\*\*.



**The study includes:**



\* An implementation of \*\*Ada-Hessian using Hutchinson’s method\*\* for Hessian diagonal approximation

\* \*\*Spatial (block-wise) averaging\*\* to reduce stochastic curvature noise

\* Extensive comparison with \*\*SGD, Adam, AdamW, Adamax, Nadam, and RMSprop\*\*

\* Evaluation on multiple CSI datasets, including single-user and multi-user settings

\## 🧠 Problem Formulation



The learning objective is to minimize a non-convex empirical risk function:



\[

\\min\_{\\theta} ; L(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum\_{i=1}^{N} \\ell(x\_i, y\_i; \\theta)

]



While first-order methods rely only on gradient statistics, \*\*Ada-Hessian preconditions gradients using an approximate inverse Hessian\*\*, enabling curvature-aware updates that adapt to the geometry of the loss surface.

\## ⚙️ Methodology



\### Ada-Hessian Key Components



\* \*\*Hessian diagonal approximation\*\* via Hutchinson’s method

\* \*\*Block-wise spatial averaging\*\* of curvature estimates

\* \*\*Momentum-based smoothing\*\*, similar to Adam

\* Tunable \*\*Hessian power parameter (k)\*\* to interpolate between gradient descent and Newton-like behavior



\### Neural Network Architecture



\* CNN-based classifier for CSI tensors of shape `(200 × 60 × 3)`

\* Convolution + BatchNorm + ReLU

\* Average pooling and dropout

\* Fully connected layer with softmax activation

\## 📊 Experimental Setup



\### CSI Datasets



| Dataset | # Signs | Repetitions | # Instances |

| ------- | ------- | ----------- | ----------- |

| Home    | 276     | 10          | 2,760       |

| Lab     | 276     | 20          | 5,520       |

| Lab150  | 150     | 10          | 7,500       |



> ⚠️ Due to size constraints, \*\*only a subset of the Home dataset\*\* is included in this repository under `data/`.

\### Training Configuration



\* Batch size: 256

\* Epochs: up to 300 (Ada-Hessian typically converges within ~50 epochs)

\* Weight decay: (5 \\times 10^{-4})

\* Learning rate:



&nbsp; \* First-order optimizers: 0.01

&nbsp; \* Ada-Hessian: 0.15

\* Learning rate decay at epochs 80, 160, and 240

\## 📈 Results Summary



\* \*\*Ada-Hessian converges significantly faster\*\* than first-order optimizers

\* Demonstrates \*\*smooth and stable training behavior\*\*

\* Achieves \*\*highest validation accuracy on the Lab dataset\*\*

\* Performance is competitive with \*\*AdamW\*\*, the strongest first-order baseline



Detailed results for \*\*all configurations\*\* (learning rates, Hessian power values, weight decay settings) are available in the `results/` directory.



---



\## ⏱️ Computational Trade-offs



\* Ada-Hessian incurs \*\*3–5× higher training time\*\* due to Hessian estimation

\* However, it \*\*requires far fewer epochs to converge\*\*, reducing tuning effort

\* Particularly effective in \*\*high-variability and multi-user CSI settings\*\*



---



\## ✅ Conclusions



\* Ada-Hessian is a \*\*robust and efficient optimizer\*\* for CSI-based sign language recognition

\* Less sensitive to learning rate selection than first-order methods

\* Weight decay remains an important hyperparameter

\* Demonstrates the practical benefits of second-order information in real-world deep learning tasks
