# Comparative-Analysis-of-Ada-Hessian-and-1st-Order-Optimizers-for-CSI-Based-Sign-Language-Recognition
Comparative study of Ada-Hessian vs. first-order optimizers (SGD, Adam, AdamW, etc.) for CSI-based sign language recognition. Ada-Hessian leverages second-order curvature for faster, more stable convergence, achieving up to 99.31% accuracy and strong robustness across Wi-Fi CSI datasets.
